# IR-Communication-ES2: A Self-Made PCB Wireless Communication System

The aim of this project is to create a wireless communication system through self-made PCBs equipped with IR LEDs, which can transmit messages between devices. To generate these messages, an Arduino microcontroller or a simple button can be used, which will send the signals to the IR LEDs present on the PCBs, which will then transmit data.

This system operates by allowing one device to send a message using IR light, which can be received by another device equipped with a compatible IR receiver. The receiver will then decode the message and display it on a screen or any other output device.

In this design, every PCB is capable of full duplex communication, which means that each one can both transmit and receive messages. This feature ensures that all PCBs can communicate with each other.
